# Craigslist Gig Analysis: Structuring Unstructured Work Listings with NLP

This project applies natural language processing (NLP), clustering, and classification techniques to enhance user experience and platform intelligence for the Gigs section of Craigslist, a high-traffic but unstructured space for one-off and freelance jobs.

---

## Project Context

The Craigslist Gigs section lacks categorization and sentiment cues, making it difficult for users to find relevant and trustworthy posts. we developed a solution to:
- Group posts into meaningful themes using unsupervised learning
- Predict emotional tone using sentiment analysis and classification
- Add structure to free-text job listings, enabling smarter browsing and content moderation

---

## Objective

Enable Craigslist to:
- Organize gig ads into thematic clusters (e.g., Delivery, Events, Research, Labor)
- Detect and label tone (positive, neutral, negative) using sentiment analysis
- Flag emotionally charged or suspicious posts for moderators
- Improve the discovery experience without changing the open-posting interface

## Analytical Approach

- **Data Source**: 939 Boston-based Craigslist gig postings
- **Preprocessing**: Stopword removal, lemmatization, n-gram TF-IDF
- **Clustering**: KMeans (k=4) grouped listings into 4 gig types
- **Sentiment Labeling**: VADER lexicon applied to classify post tone
- **Modeling**: Trained 5 classifiers (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree)
- **Evaluation**: Stratified train-test split (70/30) + accuracy, F1-score
- **Best Model**: Decision Tree (Accuracy: 73%)

---

## Machine Learning Components

- **Unsupervised Learning**: KMeans clustering uncovered natural groupings in the text (Delivery, Events, Research, Manual Labor).
- **Supervised Learning**: Used VADER-labeled sentiment as targets and trained five classifiers to predict tone.
- **Model Evaluation**: Compared performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. The Decision Tree model achieved the highest performance and was selected as the final model.
- **Impact**: These ML models enable smarter search filters for users and automated flagging for moderation, creating both user and business value.
